## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is about detecting American Sign Language (ASL) characters and reading them aloud using a text-to-speech function.

We used a dataset from **Roboflow** and augmented it with additional hand sign data from our own team members. Additionally, we introduced three new custom classes:

- `delete`
- `space`
- `stop`

Since the standard ASL dataset contains 26 classes (Aâ€“Z), our dataset now includes a total of **29 classes**.
